## Setup and Configuration

### Expanding on the setup and configuration
This foundational task involves defining critical parameters that dictate the bot's operational behavior and debugging capabilities. By setting TRACE_MODE to false, we ensure the application runs without verbose diagnostic outputs, suitable for a production environment or when debugging is not required. This can be toggled to true during development phases to gain insights into the bot's decision-making processes or to troubleshoot issues.

The botName variable is a placeholder for the chatbot's identity, allowing developers or users to assign a unique name that can be referenced within the bot's responses or logging statements. This customization enhances the personalization of the chatbot, making it more engaging and identifiable during interactions.

In essence, these settings serve as the initial configuration step, laying the groundwork for the chatbot's behavior and its interaction with users. Adjusting these parameters allows for a flexible setup, catering to different environments and use cases, from development and testing to deployment in live scenarios.
