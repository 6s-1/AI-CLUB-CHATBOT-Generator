## Task-3 Setup and Configuration

### Expanding on the setup and configuration
This foundational task involves defining critical parameters that dictate the bot's operational behavior and debugging capabilities.

1. Create private static final boolean TRACE_MODE = false; Here we are creating a final Boolean
variable with initial value of false. The final keywork in this line makes sure that this
variable value cannot be changed. This variable is used to set the trace mode for later
debugging purposes.

Setting it to false ensures that the application runs without verbose diagnostic outputs, suitable for a production environment or when debugging is not required. This can be toggled to true during development phases to gain insights into the bot's decision-making processes or to troubleshoot issues.

2. Create a botName variable, this is a placeholder for the chatbot's identity, allowing developers or users to assign a unique name that can be referenced within the bot's responses or logging statements. This customization enhances the personalization of the chatbot, making it more engaging and identifiable during interactions.

### Your code should now look like this:

In essence, these settings serve as the initial configuration step, laying the groundwork for the chatbot's behavior and its interaction with users. Adjusting these parameters allows for a flexible setup, catering to different environments and use cases, from development and testing to deployment in live scenarios.
